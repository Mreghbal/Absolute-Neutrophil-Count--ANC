# Absolute-Neutrophil-Count--ANC
Python code for calculating Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) using the White Blood Cell (WBC) count and the percentage of neutrophils. It includes all the required parameters and handles the calculations based on actual conditions
This code defines a function calculate_anc that takes in the White Blood Cell (WBC) count and the percentage of neutrophils as parameters. It then calculates the Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) by multiplying the WBC count with the neutrophil percentage divided by 100.

The example usage at the end demonstrates how to call the function with sample values. You can modify the values of wbc_count and neutrophil_percentage to calculate the ANC for different scenarios.

Please note that this code provides a basic implementation for calculating ANC using the WBC count and neutrophil percentage. In clinical practice, there may be additional considerations or adjustments depending on specific guidelines, medical conditions, and other factors. Therefore, it's important to consult with healthcare professionals or refer to established protocols for accurate ANC calculations in clinical settings.

In addition to using the White Blood Cell (WBC) count and neutrophil percentage, there are a few other methods for calculating the Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC). Here are two commonly used alternative approaches:

1. Manual Neutrophil Count:
Instead of relying on the neutrophil percentage, this method involves manually counting the absolute number of neutrophils in a blood smear under a microscope. The ANC is then calculated by multiplying the manual neutrophil count by the appropriate factor based on the total WBC count.

2. Complete Blood Count (CBC) with Differential:
A Complete Blood Count (CBC) test provides a breakdown of different types of white blood cells, including neutrophils. By obtaining the absolute counts of each type of white blood cell from the CBC with differential, the ANC can be directly calculated by summing the absolute counts of the neutrophils.

It's important to note that different methods may be used in different clinical settings or situations, depending on available resources, time constraints, and specific requirements. The choice of method may also depend on the accuracy and precision required for the ANC calculation in a particular medical context.

When calculating ANC, it's recommended to follow established guidelines and consult with healthcare professionals who are familiar with the specific protocols and practices employed in your region or healthcare facility. They can provide guidance on the most appropriate method for ANC calculation based on the specific circumstances.
