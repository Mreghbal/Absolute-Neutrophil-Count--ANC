# Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) Calculator

This repository contains a Python script that calculates the Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) using the White Blood Cell (WBC) count and the percentage of neutrophils. The ANC is an important parameter used in clinical practice to assess the immune system's ability to fight infections. This README provides a detailed explanation of the subject, step-by-step instructions on running and using the code, and information on how to connect with me on LinkedIn and Twitter.

## Introduction
The Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) is a measure of the number of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, in a given volume of blood. Neutrophils play a crucial role in the body's defense against bacterial and fungal infections. ANC is commonly used in clinical settings to assess a patient's risk of developing infections and to guide treatment decisions, such as the administration of antibiotics or the adjustment of chemotherapy doses.

This repository provides a Python function, `calculate_anc`, that takes the White Blood Cell (WBC) count and the percentage of neutrophils as input parameters and calculates the ANC. The formula used for the calculation is:

```
ANC = WBC count * neutrophil percentage / 100
```

## Explanation
The `calculate_anc` function in the script performs the following steps to calculate the ANC:

1. Accepts the `wbc_count` and `neutrophil_percentage` as input parameters.
2. Multiplies the `wbc_count` by the `neutrophil_percentage` divided by 100 to obtain the ANC.
3. Returns the calculated ANC value.

The example usage provided in the script demonstrates how to call the `calculate_anc` function with sample values. You can modify the values of `wbc_count` and `neutrophil_percentage` to calculate the ANC for different scenarios.

## Usage
To use this code, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository your local machine or download the `calculate_anc.py` file.
2. Make sure you have Python installed on your system (version 3.0 or above).
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate the directory where the `calculate_anc.py` file located.
4. Run the following command to execute the script:

   ```bash
   python calculate_anc.py
  `

5. The script will output the calculated ANC value based on the provided `wbc_count` and `neutrophil_percentage`.

Feel free to modify the values of `wbc_count` and `neutrophil_percentage` in the example usage section to calculate the ANC for different scenarios.
